# Database 

A database is a storage medium organized according to data structure to manage and store data. Developed over sixty years ago, databases have evolved alongside information technology and market needs. Since the 1990s, data management has expanded from simple storage to various forms of data management that meet user needs. Databases come in many forms, from basic data tables to large-scale systems capable of massive data storage, and they are widely used in many fields.
