# MySQL Database  

MySQL is a database software based on a Client/Server (C/S) architecture, consisting of two parts: the client and the server.  

- To access the server, the client must be used.  
- The server should always be running, while the client runs only when needed.

## Interaction Process  

### 1. Client Connection and Authentication  
To connect to the server and authenticate, use the following command:  

```bash
mysql.exe -hPup

-h: Host address. For local connections, use localhost; for remote connections, use the IP address.
-P: Port number, used to locate the server.
-u: Username.
-p: Password.
2. Sending SQL Commands
The client sends SQL commands to the server.

3. Server Processing
The server receives the SQL commands, processes them, and returns the results.

4. Displaying Results
The client receives the results and displays them.

5. Disconnecting
To avoid overloading the server due to concurrent connections, it is necessary to disconnect after completing tasks. Use one of the following commands to disconnect and free resources:

exit
quit
\q
Server Objects
Since the internal structure of the server cannot be fully understood, we can only analyze its architecture at a high level.

Generally, the internal objects of a MySQL database server are divided into four layers:

Database Management System (DBMS)
Database (DB)
Table
Field
javascript
