# Database

## 1. Definition
A database can be simply explained as an efficient medium for storing and processing data. It is mainly divided into two types based on storage media: disk and memory.

## 2. Classification
Databases can be categorized into two main types:

- **Relational Databases (SQL)**: Use structured schemas and tables.
- **Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL, Not Only SQL)**: Typically use flexible schemas for unstructured data.

## 3. Examples

### Relational Databases:
- **Large**: Oracle, DB2, etc.
- **Medium-sized**: SQL Server, MySQL, etc.
- **Small**: Access, etc.

### Non-Relational Databases:
- Examples: Memcached, MongoDB, Redis, etc.

## 4. Distinctions

### Relational Database:
- **Safety**: Data is stored on disk, making it highly unlikely to lose data.
- **Space Efficiency**: May waste space due to the two-dimensional table format used for storage.

### Non-Relational Database:
- **Efficiency**: Generally more efficient for data storage.
- **Security**: Less secure; a sudden power failure can lead to data loss.
